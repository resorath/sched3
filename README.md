sched3
======

A rewrite of the IT Scheduler used by the University of Calgary's IT Support Centre.

### History and motivation

The first <i>super scheduler</i> used by the IT Support Centre, as well as <i>Shift Swap Utility</i> were rewritten and
combined to create an application that was more user friendly and feature rich. However this new scheduler application 
(simply called "sched") was hacky in its codebase and was bound to the look and feel of the existing scheduler.

### Scheduler 3

The third iteration of the ITSC's scheduler web application breaks the mould of the previous iterations with an all
new design; both from a user experience standpoint and from a code standpoint. Scheduler 3 is a delight to 
use and maintain.
